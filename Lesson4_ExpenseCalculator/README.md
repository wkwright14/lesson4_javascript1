2. (JavaScript can be added to HTML in two different ways: either embed the JavaScript code or embed the JavaScript in an external file. This can be done in the head or body of HTML text.)
3. (A script is able to alter content depending on what input is given by the user or other indications, such as a server clock, hidden input, and cookies. The user's input can be informed by a dialogue box, in which the user must choose a prompt.)
